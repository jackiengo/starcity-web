      <h4>Economy</h4>
      <p>Research indicates that the odds of rising to another income level are notably higher in great cities. Simply put, the best cities foster the highest probability of economic success.</p>

      <p>Suburban sprawl is not good for the environment. City dwellers consume 30% less gasoline. Urban dwellers require fewer resources in sum than their suburban counterparts. We enable more people to live sustainably in urban environments.</p>

        <p>We welcome this challenge because we don't want to lose the amazing character of the cities we love.</p>

        <p>New supply of low income housing is made possible through government subsidies and public vouchers, and we all know that there's no shortage of luxury high-rises going up — but what about everyone in between?</p>
        <p>Our mission is to house the backbone of every city: the teachers, police officers, firefighters, hospitality workers, students and entrepreneurs, which in turn makes cities accessible to everyone.</p>

        <h4>Building a sustainable future</h4>
        <p>Sustainability is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Starcity’s value engineering takes into consideration both the initial and life-cycle costs of a building. Our approach deals with all the surrounding resources such as water, energy, and materials from their beginning as raw materials till their salvage cycle.</p>

        <h4>Increasing livable space and reducing waste</h4>
        <p>The lack of capital for middle-income developments also means that we, as a society, lack the ability to challenge assumptions about what the middle-income urban dweller needs and desires. How much private space do we need? What do we expect for community and neighborhood interaction? What tradeoffs are we willing to make to have a fulfilling urban experience? To answer these questions, Starcity is reimagining the physical spaces in which we live, with direct input from our members.</p>

        <p>Jon has lived in San Francisco since rent for an apartment was ~$1,000 (a long time ago). He grew up in Palo Alto, where his family fostered a communal lifestyle with people from around the world. They shacked up in the family’s cottage and developed a deep sense of (hippie) community spirit. At Starcity, Jon shapes company culture, finds and closes deals to grow Starcity's network of communal homes, identifies future growth opportunities and handles public relations.</p>

She discovered her penchant for nurturing community in college while working on a community arts magazine, and later learned how to design the built environment for it at a residential interior design firm. Meg honed the art of customer service as a general manager in the hospitality industry, and recently refined her community management skills by developing a coworking space in San Francisco. At Starcity, Meg facilitates the growth of the communities, leads the efforts to deliver exceptional member experiences and contributes to brand and marketing efforts.</p>

        <p>Living in Brooklyn sparked her love for intentional living and grew a desire to connect with individuals, that led to certifications in both yoga and massage therapy. Ela is now happy to call San Francisco home and spends her time working as the Community Manager at Starcity's second community and is a massage therapist at Studiomix.</p>
